        <div class="text-base mb-6">
          It all started on January 29, 2022 when I saw an article mentioning{" "}
          <a
            class="underline"
            href="https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle"

          by Guilherme S. T&#246;ws and we all started playing it as a group. It
          was a blast to play something more difficult than Wordle, but we still
          found it uncommon to fail to guess both words in 7 attempts.
          <br />
          <br />
          In a moment of evil and genius,{" "}
          <a
            class="underline"
            href="https://github.com/DavidMah"
            target="_blank"
          >
            David Mah
          </a>{" "}
          hacked together the first prototype of Quordle on January 30th and
          linked it to the group chat. It was truly horrific code (it even had 2
          keyboards &#128517;), but I knew that I had to continue the madness.
          With hindsight, he really baited me into finishing his monstrous
          creation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the next 2 days I improved the code, removed the second keyboard,
          and added the color quadrant keyboard. I even added Google Analytics
          thinking it would be funny to see the stats for our friend group
          playing.
          <br />
          <br />
          At first it was just a few dozen players (there was a group of 20-30
          people in Ohio that were playing constantly the first few days). But
          then Quordle got written about in an article in{" "}
          <a
            class="underline"
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/06/worried-about-losing-wordle-here-are-some-alternatives-just-in-case"
            target="_blank"
          >
            The Guardian
          </a>{" "}
          and things exploded quickly from there. Now Quordle has over 60k
          players daily and has had over 160k total players.
          <br />
          <br />
          A shoutout to our friend that plays relentless while indoor cycling.
          You were the drive to create a better version and your passion made me
          realize it could be popular outside of our friend group. I am so glad
          the world has been thoroughly cursed by Quordle and can't wait to see
          how Quordle strategies evolve!
          <br />
          <br />I have no plans to monetize Quordle, I just enjoy watching
          everyone enjoy this insane game and couldn't have done it without
          Guilherme S. T&#246;ws and David Mah. If you have any ideas for
          Quordle or just want to chat, check out the socials posted above.
